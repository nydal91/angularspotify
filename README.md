This is a custom spotify artist/album reader. 
if problem to install,
go to app/app.component.ts
and delete line 21. npm start it. and paste it again at 21.


```bash
npm install
npm start
```

> If the `typings` folder doesn't show up after `npm install` please install them manually with:

> `npm run typings -- install`

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.
